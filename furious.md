go get -u github.com/liamg/furious

Options
-s [TYPE] --scan-type [TYPE]

Use the specified scan type. The options are:
Type 	Description
syn 	A SYN/stealth scan. Most efficient scan type, using only a partial TCP handshake. Requires root privileges.
connect 	A less detailed scan using full TCP handshakes, though does not require root privileges.
device 	Attempt to identify device MAC address and manufacturer where possible. Useful for listing devices on a LAN.

The default is a SYN scan.
-p [PORTS] --ports [PORTS]

Scan the specified ports. Defaults to a list of all known ports as provided by IANA.

Ports may be specified using a comma delimited list, and ranges are also allowed.

For example:

--ports 22,80,443,8080-8082

...will scan 22, 80, 443, 8080, 8081, and 8082.
-t [MS] --timout-ms [MS]

The network timeout to apply to each port being checked. Default is 1000ms.
-w [COUNT] --workers [COUNT]

The number of worker routines to use to scan ports in parallel. Default is 1000 workers.
-u --up-only

Only show output for hosts that are confirmed as up.
--version

Output version information and exit.
Usage

Furious can be used to:
Find open ports on one or more hosts

Scan a single host:

furious 192.168.1.4 

Scan a whole CIDR:

furious 192.168.1.0/24 

Scan a mixture of IPs, hostnames and CIDRs

furious -s connect 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1/24 google.com

Run a SYN (stealth) scan (with root privileges)

sudo -E furious -s syn 192.168.1.1

Run a connect scan as any user

furious -s connect 192.168.1.1

Identify device MAC address and manufacturer within a local network

furious -s device 192.168.1.1/24 -u

Troubleshooting
sudo: furious: command not found

If you installed using go, your user has the environment variables required to locate go programs, but root does not. You need to:

sudo env "PATH=$PATH" furious
